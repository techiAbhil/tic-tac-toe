# Tic Tac Toe: A Beginners Project

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is a fairly simple react app specially for the beginners. Here we are using a single functional component with the `useState` react hook & the rest of focuses on the business login, HTML & CSS code snippets.
